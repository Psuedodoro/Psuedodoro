# Old, deleted and a small amount of repos statement

If you are looking for any of my old projects, repositories or code - they are no longer on my GitHub account. They do however have a new home on GitLab which is where they will stay. The reason behind this is because sadly, people take the mickey out of my old projects and I do not respect or want that anymore. So, from now on - my GitHub will be for all of my main projects and repos and my [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Psuedodoro) account will be like an archive or vault if you will for all my old repos.

You may also be wondering why I only have around 2-4 repos (at the time of writing this readme) that is because I archived my old repos (like said above) and deleted junk repos that no one reads or uses. More repos will be coming soon as I am working on coding more and pushing more stuff to GitHub.

Hope you do understand,
